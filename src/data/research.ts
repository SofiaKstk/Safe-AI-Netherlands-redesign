/**
 * Research Hub facts: what has been published, and who supervises.
 *
 * Shared by the landing page (the inverse "Already in the literature" band and
 * the supervisor list) and /research, so a new paper or a new supervisor is
 * added in exactly one place.
 *
 * Venue strings say "workshop" wherever the paper is a workshop paper. All five
 * formal-venue papers here are workshop papers, and a bare "NeurIPS 2025" reads
 * as main track to the exact reader this page is written for. Saying it plainly
 * is the credibility move, not a weakness.
 *
 * The Apart Research placements ("1st Place", "3rd Place", "4th Place") are
 * repo-only: design/briefs/research-evidence.md could not confirm any rank at
 * source. They are held as the soft "Apart Research hackathon" label until
 * someone reads the rank off each project page.
 *
 * Self-Ablating Transformers is a four-person paper (Ferrao, Mikaelson, Pepper,
 * Perez-Campanero Antolin), not Ferrao solo; the author list was corrected
 * against the published paper.
