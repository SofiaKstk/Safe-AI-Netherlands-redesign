/* A person in a role, on the light ground. The same device the research band
 * ships on inverse (ResearchPeople): a square tile in a wrapping row, the
 * frame holding still while the portrait moves inside it, an orange rule
 * drawing under the serif name from the left. Square because everything in
 * this system is square; never a circle, never an initial avatar.
 *
 * The ink flips for the ground: hairlines are navy at low opacity instead of
 * white, the name is navy, the role sits at navy/70. Hover cues repeat on
 * focus-visible because a keyboard never fires :hover, and both transforms
 * sit behind motion-safe.
 *
 * Photographs are served as plain <img> with a hand-built srcSet: `output:
 * "export"` ships next/image unoptimized, so without one every tile downloads
 * the full-size original, and these originals run to 1.6MB each.
