/**
 * The three featured papers, as cream cards on the band's navy.
 *
 * Five rows at lg -- plate, venue, title, summary, link -- and each card is a
 * subgrid of them, so the three titles start on one line and the three links
 * end on one line whatever the copy does. The `min-h` reservations this used
 * to carry did the same thing by guessing a line count, and a venue label one
 * word longer was enough to break the row.
 *
 * The card carries the paper's full title, the same string /research lists it
 * under, so a reader who follows "View all publications" is looking for a name
 * they have already read. It ran here under a short `chipTitle` before, which
 * left the same paper with two names on two pages, and the full one reached
 * nobody: it was in `title=`, which is a tooltip, so no keyboard, no touch and
 * no screen reader ever saw it.
 *
 * Set a step down from the summary's neighbours at `text-title-sm`. An
 * academic title runs three or four lines in a card this wide, and at 21px it
 * became the only thing on the card.
 *
 * Hover had one cue and it was invisible: cream to white is about a percent of
 * luminance. Now the plate behind the drawing deepens, the title underlines,
 * and the arrow leans the way it sends you. design.md keeps this landing still
 * by default, so all three are small, all three are the same 200ms, and the
 * only one that moves is gated on motion-safe.
 *
 * The plate runs the full width of the card. It used to be inset by the same
 * 24px as the text, which drew a second box inside the first one and left the
 * drawing sitting in a tinted rectangle floating on a cream rectangle. A card
 * with a picture in it has one field at the top and one column of type under
 * it; the drawing keeps its own inset, so nothing actually touches the edge
 * except the tint.
