/* The supervisors, as a left-aligned row of square portraits.
 *
 * They were circles with centred captions, which is the stock team-grid and
 * the only rounded thing on a page whose whole system is square: hairlines,
 * square tabs, square buttons, square prints. A square also matches the source
 * photographs exactly, so nobody's face is cropped to fit a frame.
 *
 * The captions are left-aligned under the tile now. This page sets everything
 * from a left margin except one centred section header; five centred captions
 * in a row put five ragged axes into an editorial layout.
 *
 * Fixed 140px tiles in a wrapping flex row rather than five stretched grid
 * columns. Held at this size the 312px source still lands above 2x on a retina
 * screen, and the air between the tiles comes from the gap rather than from
 * columns padding themselves out.
 *
 * Hover and focus: the frame holds still and the portrait moves inside it, the
 * hairline brightens, and an orange rule draws under the name from the left.
 * design.md asks for colour to be paired with a non-colour cue, which is what
 * the rule and the zoom are. Tailwind v4 already gates `hover:` behind
 * `@media (hover: hover)`, so none of it fires from a tap; every cue repeats on
 * `group-focus-visible:` because a keyboard never fires `:hover`, and the two
 * transforms sit behind `motion-safe:`.
