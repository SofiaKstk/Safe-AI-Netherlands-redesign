/**
 * Five photographs from rooms that happened, each named by its caption bar.
 *
 * The landing's prints argue "there are real rooms"; these have a harder job.
 * This band claims a rhythm -- a hackathon weekend, a graduation dinner, a
 * scenario discussion, a pub quiz -- so each print has to say which city and
 * which kind of evening it is, or the reader has five crowds and no month. That
 * is the caption bar (navy at 88%, serif italic), the treatment design.md gives
 * a course image, carried onto the mat.
 *
 * Geometry follows the landing: a snap strip you push with a thumb below xl,
 * where a print is between roughly 280 and 390 CSS wide and the next one runs
 * off the screen edge as the affordance, and a tilted scatter from xl where the
 * five of them reach their full width on the 1440 canvas.
 *
 * `output: "export"` ships next/image unoptimized, so each print carries its
 * own srcSet off the webp rungs scripts/generate-responsive-images.mjs writes
 * beside the sources. The ladder therefore lives in two places and has to
 * agree: `rungs` below names only the widths that exist on disk, because a
 * rung wider than its source is skipped by the generator and a srcSet entry
 * pointing at a file nobody wrote is a broken image at that breakpoint.
