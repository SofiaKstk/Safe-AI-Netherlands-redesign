/**
 * The /courses variant of the landing's CourseTabs. Same three tracks, same
 * geometry: three square tabs over one panel, the active tab white with a 3px
 * orange underline that slides between tabs.
 *
 * It exists as its own file for two reasons. Each panel opens with a "who it
 * suits" line the landing does not carry, because the reader here is choosing
 * a track rather than browsing. And the copy is dash-free: the landing
 * component still ships em dashes in its outline rows, which design.md bans;
 * they are written out here with colons and words instead. Everything else --
 * track names, taglines, summaries, outlines, city rows, photographs and
 * captions -- stays canonical with the landing. If a track changes there,
 * change it here in the same commit.
 *
 * On a phone the markup interleaves header, panel, header, panel, and a track
 * can close to nothing; from md the grid lifts the headers into a 3-up strip
 * over one shared panel cell, where one is always open. A disclosure group
 * rather than a tablist, because the headers have their panels between them.
