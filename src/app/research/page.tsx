                Every supervisor keeps a public research agenda. Read it before you apply: the
                strongest expressions of interest respond to a question a supervisor has already
                posed.

                sentence that argues for it. The eligibility band already runs
                the heading-left, copy-right split, and the page uses it once. */}

                If you are an experienced researcher, usually at PhD level or above, and the
                papers above look like work you could have guided, more supervisors means more
                projects. Supervision is remote-friendly, meetings run at a cadence you agree per
                project, and the research team handles the coordination around you. Email us and
                we will follow up with next steps.
