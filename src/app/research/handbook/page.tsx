   One reading column at --container-copy, white ground, hairlines for

   which is where a printed programme carries its version and its authors, and
   the one inverse close, which the page has earned because it ends in a real
   action.

   The source document (docs/research_hub_handbook.md, v1.0) stays the

                <P>
                  SAIN exists to raise awareness of the full spectrum of
                  existing and potential harms from AI, contribute to shaping
                  mitigation priorities through ongoing discourse, and support
                  the realisation of effective solutions. The Research Hub is
                  where that turns into research: a platform where supervisors,
                  collaborators, and students connect to advance AI safety work
                  on a global and interdisciplinary scale.
                </P>
                <P>
                  This handbook applies to researchers and students working
                  under the hub, supervisors affiliated with SAIN, collaborators
                  and visiting researchers on open projects, and anyone outside
                  SAIN who wants to understand how the hub runs.

                <Turn>Almost any topic counts, if it reduces AI-related risk</Turn>
                <P>
                  We welcome any project that meaningfully contributes to AI
                  safety: technical, governance, or conceptual. If you are
                  unsure whether a topic counts, the default answer is yes,
                  provided you can articulate a plausible pathway from your work
                  to reducing AI-related risk. We mean risk broadly: risk to
                  lives, to equality, to rights. To make the scope concrete, the
                  hub especially encourages work in the following areas, without
                  being limited to them.

                  the difference between publishing and not publishing, holding
                  the principle matters more than the publication.

                      Not all research needs formal supervision. SAIN connects
                      researchers directly and provides support, such as
                      compute, so you can focus on the work. If you have a
                      research proposal, submit it via the form on our website.
                      If you want to join an existing project, reach out to that
                      project&rsquo;s contact person. Nobody plays the supervisor
                      role on these projects, but one person leads, usually
                      whoever designed the project.

                  think is unnecessary. A mechanistic interpretability tool, for
                  example, does not need a title and abstract.

                      Work on AI safety can have paradoxical effects: it can
                      make AI systems, the AI ecosystem, or people inside it
                      less safe. These effects can play out in complex ways that
                      are impossible to fully foresee. At minimum, spend some
                      time thinking about whether your work could significantly
                      increase capabilities or misuse risk if widely shared.

                  AI safety research, like any research, can be intellectually
                  and emotionally demanding, especially under the
                  publish-or-perish pressure that is unfortunately far too
                  common.
