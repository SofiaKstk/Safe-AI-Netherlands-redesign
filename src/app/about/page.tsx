              The Netherlands has the talent. It lacked the path.
            </h2>
            <div className="mt-6 flex max-w-[720px] flex-col gap-5 font-sans text-body text-navy/72">
              <p>
                Some harms from AI are already routine: deepfakes, misinformation, systems tuned to
                hold attention at the cost of mental health. Others grow with the systems
                themselves. The more capability and autonomy we hand to AI, the harder it becomes to
                keep meaningful human control, and a system that fails does not check who built it.
                The harm lands on the people and institutions that deployed it as much as on anyone
                else.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nobody can say how fast this goes, and we will not pretend to. The honest position
                is that readiness is not something the Netherlands has by default. It is something
                people build.
              </p>
              <p>
                This country has world-class universities, a strong tech sector, and institutions
                like ASML. What it lacked was a unified civil-society voice on AI safety, and a
                clear route for a talented person to get from curiosity to meaningful contribution.
                SAIN was created to close that gap. Our answer is not a campaign but human capital:
                people who understand the risks, have the skills to address them, and sit where they
                can act.

                The drawing beside this text is the whole organisation. The wide end is a free
                course anyone can join, no technical background required. The narrow end is
                full-time work on AI safety, in policy, research, industry or civil society. Between
                them sit the community, the Research Hub, and fellowships. We call it the SAIN
                talent pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are open about where our effort goes. SAIN builds the wide end: getting people
                in, teaching foundations, and scaffolding a first real contribution such as a
                supervised research project. At the narrow end we mainly connect and refer, with
                introductions and referral letters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Leaving the pipeline early is not failure. Someone who finishes one course and
                returns to law, medicine or public administration carries that literacy into their
                field, and a society that understands AI risk is itself an outcome we want.

              So far the pipeline has produced more than 100 course graduates across nine-plus
              cohorts, currently around 60 a year, and peer-reviewed research at NeurIPS and ICLR.
              The aim for mid-2027 is 250 or more graduates a year, reached by running the same
              standardised course in more cities, not by diluting it.

              SAIN is a Dutch foundation, a stichting, the standard nonprofit legal form. The
              foundation holds the brand, the legal entity and the finances, so a local chapter
              never has to build those from scratch; chapters run their own courses, events and
              communities. Every programme is free. Three documents define how the whole thing
              works, and anyone can read them.

              rows the documents read as one index with the two doors under
              them, in the same idiom. */}
